## Overview
- Analyzed testimonial interview texts of 10 Auschwitz survivors using GPT and Python.
- Conducted analysis on key experiences frequently mentioned in survivors' testimonies, such as liberation, camp life, separation from family, starvation, deportation, and forced labor.
- Tracked emotional shifts of the 10 survivors based on Paul Ekman's emotion theory.
- Categorized their life stages into five phases: early life, pre-war, early war, Auschwitz, and post-war; identified and analyzed the intensity of six primary emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust) across these stages.
- Calculated word frequency from the interview texts of the 10 survivors, generating frequency.csv files for each and visualized the data using WordCloud.
- Explored the impact of various factors on psychological recovery post-liberation, including age at liberation, gender, homeland, return to homeland, post-war destination, occupation post-war, family reunification, camp role, post-war support network, and health state at liberation.
- Visualized correlations between family reunification, return to homeland, and psychological recovery.
- Skills: Python, PyPDF2, pandas, collections, Regular Expressions (re), Matplotlib, WordCloud, CSV
